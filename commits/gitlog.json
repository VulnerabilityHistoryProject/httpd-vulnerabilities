Basically Dirk was just\ndropping patterns of the form ${x} if x didn't resolve to an\nenvironment variable.

This is\nbasically a straight port of the 1.3 module to 2.0.  The MPMs need to be\nmodified a bit to work with mod_status, but prefork, mpmt_pthread, and\ndexter have already been changed.  I will fix perchild tonight.  There\nis a lot of common code that can be abstracted, and there seems to be a\nsmall bug with regard to what mpmt_pthread and dexter report as current\nconnections.  ExtendedStatus does work again, although until the bug\nmentioned above is fixed, it isn't as useful on mpmt_pthread and dexter.\n\nNext week, I will look at allowing other modules to add data to the\nSTATUS page and possibly to the scoreboard itself.\n\n\ngit-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk@87949 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68","insertions":3180,"deletions":1278,"filepaths":{"CHANGES":{"insertions":0,"deletions":3},"include/mpm_status.h":{"insertions":137,"deletions":0},"include/scoreboard.h":{"insertions":0,"deletions":242},"modules/generators/mod_status.c":{"insertions":36,"deletions":670},"modules/http/http_protocol.c":{"insertions":3,"deletions":13},"server/Makefile.in":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1},"server/config.m4":{"insertions":0,"deletions":4},"server/connection.c":{"insertions":5,"deletions":6},"server/mpm/beos/Makefile.in":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1},"server/mpm/beos/scoreboard.c":{"insertions":227,"deletions":0},"server/mpm/beos/scoreboard.h":{"insertions":103,"deletions":0},"server/mpm/dexter/Makefile.in":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1},"server/mpm/dexter/dexter.c":{"insertions":22,"deletions":19},"server/mpm/dexter/mpm.h":{"insertions":0,"deletions":1},"server/mpm/dexter/mpm_default.h":{"insertions":0,"deletions":3},"server/mpm/dexter/scoreboard.c":{"insertions":285,"deletions":0},"server/mpm/dexter/scoreboard.h":{"insertions":109,"deletions":0},"server/mpm/experimental/perchild/Makefile.in":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1},"server/mpm/mpmt_beos/Makefile.in":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1},"server/mpm/mpmt_beos/scoreboard.c":{"insertions":228,"deletions":0},"server/mpm/mpmt_beos/scoreboard.h":{"insertions":103,"deletions":0},"server/mpm/mpmt_pthread/Makefile.in":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1},"server/mpm/mpmt_pthread/config.m4":{"insertions":3,"deletions":0},"server/mpm/mpmt_pthread/mpm.h":{"insertions":1,"deletions":0},"server/mpm/mpmt_pthread/mpm_default.h":{"insertions":0,"deletions":3},"server/mpm/mpmt_pthread/mpmt_pthread.c":{"insertions":5,"deletions":1},"server/mpm/mpmt_pthread/scoreboard.c":{"insertions":443,"deletions":0},"server/mpm/mpmt_pthread/scoreboard.h":{"insertions":242,"deletions":0},"server/mpm/perchild/Makefile.in":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1},"server/mpm/perchild/scoreboard.c":{"insertions":285,"deletions":0},"server/mpm/perchild/scoreboard.h":{"insertions":108,"deletions":0},"server/mpm/prefork/config.m4":{"insertions":3,"deletions":0},"server/mpm/prefork/mpm.h":{"insertions":0,"deletions":1},"server/mpm/prefork/mpm_default.h":{"insertions":0,"deletions":8},"server/mpm/prefork/prefork.c":{"insertions":394,"deletions":14},"server/mpm/prefork/scoreboard.h":{"insertions":227,"deletions":0},"server/mpm/spmt_os2/scoreboard.h":{"insertions":204,"deletions":0},"server/scoreboard.c":{"insertions":0,"deletions":283}}},"4a375eff2269d4a6178997a91c22116b3df5c272":{"author":"Joe Orton","email":"jorton@apache.org","date":"2008-05-30 11:49:31 UTC","message":"Prevent CSRF attacks against the balancer-manager (CVE-2007-6420)\n\n* modules/proxy/mod_proxy_balancer.c (balancer_init): New function.\n  (balancer_handler): Place a nonce in the form output, and check that\n  the submitted form data includes that nonce.\n  (ap_proxy_balancer_register_hook): Register the new post_config hook.\n\n\ngit-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk@661666 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68","insertions":0,"deletions":43,"filepaths":{"CHANGES":{"insertions":0,"deletions":4},"modules/proxy/mod_proxy_balancer.c":{"insertions":0,"deletions":39}}},"3c5a741b5516b4ef49eaae4738e01960c3215018":{"author":"William A.

To make sure that they stay in sync; and to make it easier\nto add (http) caching modules - this change moves them all into\none place (cache_util) and exposes a in-bound and out-bound\nversion to operate on the headers.\n\nIn short: we retire ap_cache_cacheable_hdrs_out() which was used\nfor both in- and out-put headers; and replace it by a single\nap_cache_cacheable_headers() which understands the hop-by-hop\nrules. And then wrap this into an in- and out-put specific \nap_cache_cacheable_headers_in()/out() which we can teach things\nabout entity responses and so on.. The latter which will also \nmerge error and ensure content-type. \n\nThis API change bumps up the minor MM by one.    \n\n\n\ngit-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk@649162 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68","insertions":5,"deletions":83,"filepaths":{"CHANGES":{"insertions":0,"deletions":8},"include/ap_mmn.h":{"insertions":1,"deletions":3},"modules/cache/cache_util.c":{"insertions":2,"deletions":52},"modules/cache/mod_cache.h":{"insertions":2,"deletions":20}}},"9f68cf201061348d3706768c3e61096867b64df2":{"author":"Graham Leggett","email":"minfrin@apache.org","date":"2013-05-02 14:24:26 UTC","message":"mod_cache: Ignore response headers specified by no-cache=header and\nprivate=header as specified by RFC2616 14.9.1 What is Cacheable.
