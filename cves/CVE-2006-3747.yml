  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: This was a vulnerability that affected people who used Apache HTTPD
    versions 1.3 from 1.3.28 and 2.0.46.
    
    This vulnerability allowed malicious users to perform remote attacks that cause
    denial of service or random code executions. This vulnerability makes use of a
    off-by-one error which is when data being added to a stack overwrites an extra
    bit. This situation was only able to happen when certain functions of the
    rewrite module was used with Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) urls. 
    The rewrite module is capable of manipulating urls so that requests from one 
    url can be sent to another url.
    
    When data overflows past its intended boundaries, it allows for the next
    section of code in the stack to execute or it could even crash the whole
    program.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: The commit changes did not indicate that any test files were altered.
    There were test files for testing the C modules.
  code: true
  fix: false

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulnerability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: An employee at McAfee Avert Labs that goes by Mark Dowd reported this
    vulnerability to Apache.
  date: 2006-07-27
  automated: false
  google: false
  contest: false

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: mod_rewrite is one of the C modules that Apache provides.
  name: C Modules

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  answer: There were no commits that changed the method where the vulnerability
    was present between the VCC and fix except for the fix itself. There were
    numerous commits between the VCC and fix which mostly had to do with 
    optimizations, updating licenses, fixing copyrights, and altering functionality
    for other methods.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: There were no notable major events that occurred around this time.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: It seems like the fault was in the code. The fix was a simple change
    by decreasing a variable in an if statement by 1. Considering that the change
    was a simple fix of just editing one line of code, the cause was likely due to
    accidently overlooking a size limit when the code was made. Vulnerabilities 
    that have to do with size boundaries are easily overlooked which is why I 
    think additional boundary checking should have been done. Boundary tests
    should always check for extreme cases like maximum inputs.
