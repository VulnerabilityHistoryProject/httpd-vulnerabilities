  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  This a vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker using cross-site scripting.
  The imagemap processing module can cause the referer header to be output without being
  escaped in HTML. An attacker who is able to influence the referer header will be able
  to use cross-site scripting to attack.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    After researching it seems like CERT reported the bug. But it wasn't really
    detailed whether or not it was done through automated unit testing or not. 
    It did not seem like they unit tested after the fix. It seemed like after the
    fix they tested by creating a victim site with a vulnerable mod_imap configuration 
    and an attacker site with scripts for attacking. When the attacker site was visited
    using Internet Explorer, it was able to steal the users private cookies.

  fix: true

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    CERT notified securite@apache.org of the flaw, then ASF verified the flaw.

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: The location of this is based on the location of the problem code.

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: The only major events were the fact that they for about a month they were 
          trying to ask contact CERT, asking for co-ordinated release and 
          reporter info. They weren't getting any answers so they made the bug 
          public on 2005-12-12
  events: true

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    note: The patch cannot be used in all aspects of the project. Where this patch
          can't be used the "referer" directive is removed from any map files. This 
          would be considered as securiy by obscurity because the developers just decided 
          to protect something from an attacker by simply removing it.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    This vulnerability seems to be a result of design mistakes and a lack of maintainability.
    They didn't consider this scenario when they were designing the project at all. The fix
    for this problem isn't applicable to all aspects of the project so I would say that the 
    maintainability is fairly low as well.
    
    CWE-80 is "Basic XSS." It is when the software does correctly neutralize special characters.
    This is the case here. The referer header is being escaped in the HTML because the special 
    characters were not being handled correctly. The mitigation for this is checking each input.
    All data in the request, including hidden fields, cookies, headers, the URL itself, and so 
    forth must all be checked. In this particular situation they just added a conditional.
    
    The vulnerabilities fix does not seem very maintainable. The patch doesn't apply everwhere. 
    If the software is not understood, repairable or enhanceable it can't be considered maintainable.
    The fact that the patch can't be applied everywhere implies that the software isn't understood
    or repairable. 
    
    Overall it seems like the fix was effective. Even though it doesn't apply everywhere they know
    that they can just remove the referer where it doesn't apply. It seems like the solution is not 
    ideal but it is working so it's alright.
