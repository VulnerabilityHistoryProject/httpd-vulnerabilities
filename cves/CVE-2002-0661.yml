CVE: CVE-2002-0661

CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)
CWE: 23

curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.
curated: true

announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
announced: 2002-08-12

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
    This vulnerability was a simple example of directory traversal. Strings were 
    sanitized for '/', but for nothing else. This allowed attackers to user '\' 
    instead to bypass sanitization. This, paired with '..' could be used to traverse 
    the directory and access whatever files the attacker wishes.

  If you came across any indications that a bounty was paid out for this
  vulnerability, fill it out here. Or correct it if the information already here
  was wrong. Otherwise, leave it blank.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: | 
    Automatic testing is sparse in this 20-year-old codebase, with none directly 
    testing the vulnerable code, and no tests were updated in the fix.
  code: false
  fix: false

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulnerability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    The vulnerability was found by Auriemma Luigi, a third-party security researcher. 
    He found it by constructing an exploit by hand which allowed him to traverse the 
    filepath.
  date: 2002-08-07
  automated: false
  google: false
  contest:

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: Based on filepaths (server/util.c) and bug report description.
  name: server

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
    - commit: 238a9d6e51ba186e6903272c16a6ec695e3654d6
      note: |
        Much development occurred on mod_negotiation.c, the primary file containing 
        the vulnerability, but little was relevant to the vulnerability as the file 
        is quite large. This is the only commit which works with this area of the code. 
        It adds a comment which illustrates that the author considered path traversal 
        and the current way it is handled but did not consider that checking for '/' 
        would be insufficient.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    While this vulnerability was present in the system, the development team was 
    building Apache 2.0 and preparing for release. They were preparing new features 
    like multithreading and filtering. The vulnerability would be detected within 
    months of Apache 2.0's release, but not before.
  events:
    - name: Migrate from 1.3.9 repository to current repository
      date: 1999-08-24
    - name: Apache 2.0 released
      date: 2002-04-06

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    note: |
      Sanitization is more than just checking for the obvious characters. 
      You need to think outside the box to find less obvious vulnerabilities, 
      such as this, where '/' was covered, but not '\', which can be used in 
      non-UNIX environments.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    The code mistake made here was only checking for '/' when sanitizing a 
    potential path traversal vulnerability. If I try to put myself into the 
    minds of the developers, I imagine they, likely with mostly UNIX experience, 
    simply did not consider that backslashes could be used for path traversal 
    in other operating systems. Even one developer who looked at and commented 
    on the code in question between the VCC and the fix did not catch the issue 
    before release. This shows the importance of thoroughly testing and viewing 
    your software from different perspectives, which might reveal new problems.
