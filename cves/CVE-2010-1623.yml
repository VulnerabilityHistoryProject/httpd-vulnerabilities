description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  When HTTPD processes non-SSL (unencrypted) traffic, the way they process that
  data was flawed that allowed for memory to fill up. With carefully timed
  packets, an attacker could make the HTTPD process fill up on memory and cause
  a denial of service. The logic has to do with how timeout policies are
  enforced across core multiple modules in HTTPD.

  The subsystem, mod_reqtimeout, is designed to be "a convenient way to set
  timeouts and minimum data rates for receiving requests. Should a timeout occur
  or a data rate be to low, the corresponding connection will be closed by the
  server" (from https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mod_reqtimeout.html).
  It is a filtering module, which works with HTTPD's "bucket brigade" model of
  accepting and parsing network data into the HTTPD quickly.

  In this vulnerability, the policy was loose by allowing 30 seconds to "linger"
  when a connection was scheduled for closing. This gives ample time for
  attackers to send crafted packets and fill up RAM. Instead, the policy was
  changed to 2 seconds, along with a big rewrite of how the policies are
  enforced.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    The fix to this vulnerability was a signifiant rewrite of the original
    functionality. The issue was not a small coding mistake, but a poor algorithm
    choice and poor defaults. More integration testing would have helped with this,
    especially with a memory management tool like Valgrind.
