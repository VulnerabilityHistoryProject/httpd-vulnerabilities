description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  In HTTPD, an open source web server for Unix-like systems, HTTP/2 requests
  could be crafted in a way that could cause mod_http2 module to dereference
  a NULL pointer and crash the server process. The code causing the
  vulnerability was attempting to dereference the pointer before checking
  it and ensuring it is not NULL, so a request with a NULL pointer crashed the
  process. HTTP/2 requests refer to HTTP/2.0 which is a revision of the HTTP
  network protocol.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    From looking at the code that introduced the fix, it does not seem that any
    tests were involved, at least not in the commit containing the fix for the
    issue or the few commits before/after it.
  code: false
  fix: false

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    Someone named Robert Swiecki reported the issue to the security team. The
    security team credited him for finding the issue in the converstion.
  date: 2016-11-18
  automated: false
  google: false
  contest: false

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: Based on the source code fix and vcc
  name: http2

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
    - commit: 29f50cf567423ca354ee0d5fa0dfb015c555cf55
      note: |
        The commit that introduced the issue was replacing a module that was
        being reused. I find it interesting that they did that when, as far as
        I know, resue is a good thing in software!

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    I did not come across any major events when looking into this vulnerability.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.
  defense_in_depth:
    applies: true
    note: |
      I believe defense in depth applies here since the bad input causing the
      vulnerability could have been prevented had there been a layer for
      validation that stopped the malicious input before it propagated in the
      system and caused the server process to crash.

    note: |
      If the input in the request was validated before it had been used, this
      vulnerability would have been avoided but the code attempted to dereference
      the pointer before checking its validity.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    I am sure its not as simple as it seems but I think replacing a module that
    was being reused could be a mistake. I am sure the development team had
    valid reasons at the time for doing so but I cant help but wonder why they
    felt the need to do it. The replaced module did not seem to belong to a
    third party which meant they had control over it. In the future, to avoid
    this kind of vulnerability, outside input must always be validated before
    inner components put it to use.
