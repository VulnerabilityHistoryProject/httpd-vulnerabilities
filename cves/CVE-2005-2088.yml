CVE: CVE-2005-2088
CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)
CWE: 444
curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.
curated: true
announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
announced: 2005-07-05T04:00Z
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: | 
  This vulnerability occured when the HTTP Server was acting as an HTTP proxy.
  The vulnerability allowed remote attackers to perform an attack now known as Http Request Smuggling. Essentially attackers could send an HTTP request to the proxy
  with two kinds of Headers (Transfer-Encoding chunked" header and a Content-Length header). This caused apache to process the body of the request in such way and forward it so that the 
  receiveing server would process it as a seperate request. This opened a vulnerability to Cross Site Scripting.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: | 
    It does not appear that the vulnerability was detected by Unit Testing, 
    nor is there any evidence that unit testing was improved because of the vulnerability

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: There does not seem to be any evidence as to now the vulnerability was found
  date: 	2005-06-11
  automated: false
  google: false
  contest: 

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: The source files changed to fix the vulnerability were located within the proxy subsystem in the codebase. 
  name: mod_proxy

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
    - commit: 64275264ec894031f6d69c2eb387a5a888637b98
      note: This was the last commit in a series of major updates to the vulnerability affected part of code. This update with mod_proxy is interesting because it also seems to center around cookie updates, as did the VCC that created the issue to begin with.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.

    - name: | 
        Version 2.0 was released in 2004, the same year as the vulnerability was commited to the repo. 
        It is likely that this vulnerability could have been missed because it seems like there was a focus on the new version, 
        as well as the adoption of a new License that was increasing the compatability with GPL based software etc.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

      This applies because the issue mainly revolves around trusting the input coming from the client connecting through the proxy, 
      and then passing that data off to the main server.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    This mistake seems to be a design flaw at its core, rather than a coding mistake. 
    It also could have been a series of misscommunication about what was truly needed in this parrt of the project. 
    The flaw (HTTP Request Smuggling) has four mitigations suggested by CWE. These are to use SSL only communication, use strict HTTP Parsing, and terminating the client after each request. 
    It seems like of these three, in the inital fix back in 2005, the termanting the client mitigation was used. 
    This can be avoided in the future by making sure to think about what is being forwarded when dealing with data that comes from the outside world.
