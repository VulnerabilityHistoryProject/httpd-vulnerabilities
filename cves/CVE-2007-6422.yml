  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  On sites with a specific setting (mod_proxy_balancer) enabled remote users could
  craft a request that would cause the process handling it to crash. If the server
  for the site was also multi-threaded this would lead to a denial of service attack
  on the site.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    Their code is unit tested but they don't seem to update it very frequently.
    Since launching their testing for the HTTPD servers they have only had a handful
    of requests over the 20 years it has existed. So they didn't have unit tests for this
    specific situation because they considered it an outlier and haven't updated testing.
    They also did not release any test update following the fix in February 2008.
  code: true
  fix: false

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    I found the bugzilla article on the bug but after reading it found there wasn't
    a primary contact for the bug. It seems that it was reported 2007-12-12 and was 
    found by "Security Reason" but there is no explanation beyond that of how they
    discovered it.

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: |
    It was based in the proxy subsystem. Which is a subsystem containing all of their
    HTTPD Proxies including mod_proxy_balancer.

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: d13d437e07cedfbef2a24dbd7d011384f6fa05fa
    note: |
      They added a few checks for the workers to "be proactively safe" which is in
      the same location as the balancer name but they didn't put any proactively
      safe checks in for that. Done 4 months before the bug was discovered.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

  secure_by_default:
    applies: true
    note: |
      They assumed that people would not just pass the incorect balancer name
      and so they did not have any checks for it. They just assumed it was secure
      based on the nature of it.

    note:
  complex_inputs:
    applies: true
    note: |
      They accept complex inputs into their proxy. This allows users to pass an 
      incorrect balancer in the first place. They should sanitize this input instead.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    They weren't correctly checking possible requests that could come into their
    server through a large chunk of data. They didn't sanitize the input allowing
    users to take down the server. They also just didn't think of the outliers in the
    situation. Both having the mod_proxy_balancer and multi-threaded servers on were 
    not the default so they didn't build their security around this. That is also why
    the CVE was considered only low priority because not many sites had this combo. 
    The solution was to put a check for the correct balancer name which is a fix for this
    specific issue but a better fix may be to sanitize their inputs in the first place and not
    just add to the if statement every time an issue arises.
