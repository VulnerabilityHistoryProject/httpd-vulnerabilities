CVE: CVE-2009-1890
CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)

CWE: 20

CVSS: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C

curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.

curated: true 

announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
announced: 2009-06-02

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  This vulnerability involves an edge case in which Apache HTTP Server fails 
  to prevent an incoming data stream which exceeds the expected size of the overal payload.
  As a result, malicious actors can implement denial of service attacks via carefully crafted
  payloads that indefinitely consume CPU time.

  If you came across any indications that a bounty was paid out for this
  vulnerability, fill it out here. Or correct it if the information already here
  was wrong. Otherwise, leave it blank.

     note: |
       Adds logic for throwing an error when an incoming bytes stream is larger than the originally estimated
       payload size. A respective error report is then logged for reflecting at a later date. 
vccs:
  - commit: f405783e54a5263d507cc1d672c3a209f4558770 
    note: Injects `continue` statement that allows a stream to be read in, regardless of its size.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: Apache's logs indicate that a test case was later added for CVE-2009-1890, but it does not show up in git.
  code: true
  fix: true

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: mod_proxy_http.c
  name: Proxy module within HTTPD service

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
    - commit: b0e9ee428b957177f7bb5c1271a304f611d19716
      note: | 
        Replaces legacy method for flushing backend bucket allocation by reading data buckets and storing 
        the read data in a transient bucket. 
        This commit signifies the first major change towards reading in byte streams, thereby increasing the
        odds of the vulnerability being found. Considering this occurred in 2008, and the vulnerability was 
        likely found sometime around 2009-06-02, this is a decent hypothesis. 
    - commit: 4baa3df3324ad041e4850f6297252c86918f6f6b
      note: | 
        Modifies timeout behavior such that, as long as the timeout flag isn't triggered,
        the stream will continue being read.
    - commit: 4711f90002dea305600274287e470b696f6ae79b
      note: Patch for CVE-2008-2364, implements logic to prevent multiple interim responses, thereby limiting DoS attack potential.
    - commit: c68d2bd769a447c74489a7a3e6a35f5382b700e0
      note: remove potential for memory leak. Interesting due to implication of other vulnerabilities regarding memory.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: | 
    More focused development on the proxy module seemed to occur during 2008 than prior years. 
    Full module refactors as well as other vulnerability fixes throughout this year may have 
    gotten developers into a more security-oriented mindset. Likewise, having multiple eyes on 
    the same module increases the probability of locating other vulnerabilities. 
  events:
    - name: Modify timeout behavior such that, as long as a timeout flag isn't triggered, it is read in its entirety
      date: 2008-09-20
    - name: Refactor backend data bucket handling by reading to a new location
      date: 2008-11-08
    - name: Remove memory leak within proxy module.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer:
    The core of this vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation. Due to the nature of complex 
    inputs like raw data streams, additional precautions should have been taken to enforce the security
    principles of `distrust input` as well as `secure by default`. Doing so would have prevented this
    vulnerability from lurking within the codebase for almost 4 years before being addressed.
